				<blockquote>"My name is Courtney Dotson and for the past year Peter Resch has been my ADHD Coach. Also within the year I had a 3.7 gpa for my first semester and a 4.0 gpa for my second semester. Peter has helped me gain control of my emotions and that has led to academic success for my first year in college. Through Peter's coaching style, which included: humor, shared interest in sports, personal insight, and many other great qualities, I am able to mark my freshman year off as a success. I will be forever grateful to Peter because I know I will succeed with my 3 remaining years of college."</blockquote>

				<blockquote>"Pete Resch was extremely helpful to me throughout the course of his time being my coach. Not having any prior experience with ADHD coaching, I expected our relationship to be strictly about my academic life, and boy was I wrong! What sets Pete Resch apart from the average ADHD coach is that he takes the time to connect with his students on a personal level. From the very first day of our year-long coaching relationship, Pete Resch took the time to get to know me as well as my interests and hobbies. His efforts to build a relationship early on made me feel as comfortable talking to him as I would a close friend, allowing him to work with me academically in a way that fit my needs perfectly.  I would highly recommend Pete Resch to anyone seeking ADHD coaching. No matter what your needs may be, Pete Resch will help you to work through your ADHD in a way that is just right for you."</blockquote>

In addition, he is committed to continuous learning and training to his clients' benefit. Peter dedicated his career to helping other adults understand their diagnosis and effectively manage it.

			<div class="col-sm text-left">
				<blockquote>Dear Peter</blockquote>
				<blockquote>Words can't express what I've gained through your coaching the past 7 months. Your professionalism and superior knowledge about attention deficit disorder has helped me turn my life around completely. Before I was diagnosed roughly 8 months ago, I didn't know I had ADHD. By attending my first CHAAD meeting (meeting you there) I heard one of the experts suggest hiring a coach.
							I want to fully express below how your coaching style, professionalism, and always being available has greatly impacted my life;
							I'm grateful you're my coach and look forward to working with you. Without a doubt!
							You hold me accountable in many forms (i.e. exercise, meditation, ect..)
							You continue to educate me on the subject, particularly executive function and how my brain works differently than others
							The use of timers to help me get organized, "incentive breaks", ect..
							Sharing similarities
							Short meditation exercises before our calls so that we can begin our session in the "present"
							I've learned that ADHD is a gift and you have coached me into honing my skills in a particular field where I have flourished!
							Learning about the emotional part of my brain versus the logical part

				<blockquote>Pete coached me through tough times and changed my perspective on ADHD and life in general. He introduced me to mindfulness and meditation and taught me how to master my emotions and understand and accept my ADHD brain. Pete is especially adept at coaching clients through the emotional challenges that are often overlooked in ADHD treatment plans.
							Pete is a scholar and has amassed a vast library of ADHD tools, assessments, and literature. His quest for understanding ADHD has inspired my own. 
							He put me back at the ship’s wheel after a hurricane and guided me through other storms over our three-year coaching relationship. Pete helped me find my voice, my confidence, self-appreciation, and my path in life.
							I highly recommend Peter Resch.

				<blockquote>This letter is being written in support of the application of Peter Resch for his ACC credential.  I have observed Peter's coaching in a teleclass setting. He is a good listener and uses powerful questions to elicit thoughtful responses from his clients. He is supportive and holds the clients' agenda as they move through the coaching process and experience coaching challenges. In my professional opinion, Peter Resch coaches at the ACC level and beyond.  
							I am pleased to recommend Peter Resch in his application for ACC status. He is enthusiastic and committed to coaching; and clearly demonstrates a solid understanding and use of ICF core coaching competencies. 
							If I can be of any further assistance to your committee as you review Peter's application, please contact me.
